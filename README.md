# About

The Java Swing application offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting measurement units and comparing values across different units. Its core components include MeasurementFrame, UnitFrame, ShowButton, and ShowResult. The main window, "App," has a 400x400 pixels size and a dark gray background. The GUI is divided into several panels, including the MeasurementFrame, which allows users to select a measurement type and display corresponding units in the UnitFrame. The UnitFrame displays a dropdown menu for unit selection based on the selected measurement type, and the ShowButton triggers the comparison or calculation process. The ShowResult displays the results of the conversion or comparison.

# Features

The Java Swing application offers a user-friendly interface for selecting measurement units and comparing values across different units. Its core components include the MeasurementFrame, which displays corresponding units for different measurement types, and the UnitFrame, which allows users to select specific units based on their chosen measurement type. The application also features a ShowButton that triggers comparisons or calculations, and a ShowResult panel that displays the results of conversions or comparisons. The main window, with a fixed size of 400x400 pixels and a dark gray background, is divided into several panels, including the MeasurementFrame and UnitFrame, allowing users to input data and view results. The application provides a user-friendly way to work with measurement units and perform conversions or comparisons.

# Usage

# Rating

The application is a modular design that enhances code readability and maintainability by separating components into different classes. It provides an interactive user interface, allowing users to select measurements and units from dropdown menus and enter values for comparison or calculation. The structure of the MeasurementFrame class allows for easy expansion. However, there are areas for improvement, such as unclear user feedback after input submission, lack of explicit error handling, and incomplete implementation of the Results class. These areas could be addressed by implementing input validation and error messages, and completing the Results class to serve its intended function. Despite these shortcomings, the application serves as a solid foundation for a GUI-based measurement conversion or comparison tool.
